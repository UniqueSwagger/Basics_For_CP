1. WHAT IS PROGRAMMING?

Put simply, programming is giving a set of instructions to a computer to execute. 
If you’ve ever cooked using a recipe before, you can think of yourself 
as the computer and the recipe’s author as a programmer.
The recipe author provides you with a set of instructions that you read and then follow. 
The more complex the instructions, the more complex the result!
